Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

The system call numbered 548 - sys_isolate isolates the 4th core of the CPU and removes all processes running on that core.

Implemented the RSDL scheduler - scheduler number 7 - can be set as the scheduler for a given program using the sched_setscheduler() system call.

The system call numbered 549 - sys_mmcontext can save the heap memory of a process using the argument value as 0 and then restore it back using argument value as 1.
